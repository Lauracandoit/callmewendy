Life is hard. But who doesn't have difficult moment in lifes? 
Just me, it's a bit longer. 

Today, I brought the ashes of my mom's things to scatter them on the river. A peaceful scene covers the river and the village, where kids are playing around. 
But, peace does not reside in my heart. How long it will take for my heart to feel peaceful again? 

I miss my mom.
