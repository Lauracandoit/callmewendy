What do you do during your day? 


## My day just starts

For me, my day is quite simple. Most of the time I spend working. 

Since I work from home, I always start my work early in the morning, right from my bed. Usually, I wake up just 15 minutes before my work time, start all my tools, and begin working right away. What time do you usually wake up? Most days of the week, I start my workday early, from 7 a.m., sometimes even earlier, from 6 a.m. But since I don't need to travel to work, I can just wake up 15 minutes before work, and that's enough.

And that's it. One day just starts.


### I skip breakfast

I don't eat breakfast. Not because I don't like it, but because I'm too lazy to wake up early and prepare it. 

I know. I know. I know it's not good. But... my bed is too comfy in the morning. 

So, I skip breakfast and start working right away. I usually work straight for 5-7 or even more, depends on my schedual of that day. 
Once the work is done. I will have a nap, maybe just one or two hours. 

However, I have difficulty sleeping, so sometimes I can't sleep and just stay on my phone.

## My favorite coffee
And then, I go to my favorite coffee shop. 

### Ta Coffee

On a normal day, when I can take Molly with me and the weather is not too cold, I go to Ta Coffee. It is one of my favorite coffee shops.

They offer a unique coffee experience, roasting the beans with a large machine right inside the shop. Beyond coffee, they also serve tea, milk, and more. My personal favorite is the White Coffee.

The coffee shop features two distinct spaces. Inside, you can find a quiet area perfect for work, allowing you to stay focused. Outside, you can enjoy the company of friends amidst the refreshing natural air. Both spaces are beautifully designed. While I often choose to sit inside to work, I occasionally opt for the outside area, especially when I'm accompanied by my puppy, Molly.

Ta Coffee is more than just a coffee shop; it's a serene oasis in the heart of Tay Ho. Whether you're seeking a peaceful corner to work or a lively space to chat with friends, this place offers it all. I wholeheartedly recommend visiting Ta Coffee to anyone in Hanoi. It's an experience that blends tranquility, quality, and warmthâ€”a true gem in the city's bustling landscape.

This is me and Molly at Ta Coffee.

### Izi Coffe

I like to go to Izi Coffee on rainy days, especially if Molly can come with me. They have indoor seating where my best friend Molly is allowed to join me.

The owner here is nice. She also has two dogs and always welcomes me and Molly whenever we visit.

Let me see. I think I have a picture of Molly here.

Wait a second...
Here you go.

## Learning new things
And what we do at the coffee Shop?

### As a coder
I usually spend most of the time learning coding. However, when it gets too difficult, I switch to learning something else.


### Coursera learning

I'm taking the Project Management Course on Coursera. I want to develop a manager's mindset. Even though I know I still have many things to improve if I want to become a manager, I believe the course is beneficial for me.

### Book lover 

Besides that, sometimes I want to enjoy the day and relax a little bit, so I read books. I'm a book lover! When I have my own house, I will have a big bookshelf in the living room, filled with all my favorite books. And books will be everywhere.

You know what? I used to run an online bookstore. But sadly, I didn't have much experience or knowledge. The documents and procedures I needed to work on were so complicated that my project failed. However, I'm glad I gave it a try. And of course, one day, I hope to reopen it. Next time, I hope to open an offline store as well.

## Yoga class, my favorite part 
And then, at the end of the day, I go to a yoga class close to my home. I really enjoy the time I spend there and feel much stronger and healthier since I joined.

I need to sit down a lot for work, so it's the time for my whole body to be active. Whenever my body hurts, I join the class and surprisingly, the pain goes away.

I also think it helps make my body more flexible and improves my endurance. Before, I could never run for a minute, but now I do much better.

And an important thing!! I think my body looks better, and I love it.

## Hanging out with my friends

Most of my friends live and work in Hanoi, the same city as me. However, we're all busy with work and personal life. Especially at this age, I think everyone is trying to focus on their careers. We don't have much time for each other. Maybe once every few months, we meet up to hang out, eat, and have some drinks.

Despite not meeting up often, we still text and keep each other updated about our lives.

Even though we don't see each other frequently, we still maintain a close relationship and are always there for each other when needed. I feel so lucky to have them as my friends.

## My day almost finish

So if I'm not going out with my friends, I just stay at home after the yoga class, work for a few hours, and then sleep right away once the work is done.

It might seem like a lonely day, right? But it's okay because I have Molly!
