Life is hard. But who doesn't have difficult moment in lifes? 
Just me, it's a bit longer. 

Today, I brought the ashes of my mom's things to scatter them on the river. A peaceful scene covers the river and the village, where kids are playing around. 
But, peace does not reside in my heart. How long it will take for my heart to feel peaceful again? 

Mom passed away, and I feel like nothing is really important anymore. 

Over the last 2 years, I've cried almost every day. First, it was my dad passing away, then it was my relationship ending, which I thought would last a lifetime. I felt depressed. I want him to be back. I'm afraid of everything. And I cried.

But my mom passed away in a way we least expected. The last day, we still talked, and the night before, I cried my eyes out because of love, because I missed someone. The next day, everything repeated as normal until I heard my younger sister cry. She was screaming, depressed, and asked for help.

I didnâ€™t feel anything; everything just felt so strange. What just happened? What had just happened? I should give my mom more money after this, maybe double the money I gave her every month so that she could stay at home. How long should I stay? What if my mom needs help, but I need to go to school? Can I drive from my hometown to Hanoi every day at night? She really needs help. I will try to stay. 


But she died.

I lost my mom? Is that even true? How is it even possible that I lost my mom so fast? My heart is so heavy. How many years can I exchange to have her back? What can I do to have her back? 

I'm tired.

I miss my ex-boyfriend. All I want is a hug from him. But for what? My mom passed away. I'm tired and just want to collapse. But then what? Nothing is really important. Nothing will help my poor mom stay alive.
